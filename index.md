## Introduction

This is the webpage for the fall 2022 edition of the credited courses [**IN-BIOS5000**](http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/IN-BIOS5000) (MSc level) and [**IN-BIOS9000**](http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/IN-BIOS9000) (PhD level) offered by the Department of Informatics and the Department of Biosciences at the University of Oslo (UiO) in collaboration with external contributors. It is partially funded by the [**NORBIS, the national research school in bioinformatics, biostatistics and systems biology**](https://norbis.w.uib.no/genome-sequencing-technologies-assembly-variant-calling-and-statistical-genomics-2/).

This course consists of two weeks of lectures and practicals, and a final home exam with oral presentation and questioning + a final digital written exam.


## Audience

The course is open for master and PhD students at UiO, as well as to PhD students registered through the NORBIS national research school. To earn credits for the course, PhD students from other institutions than UiO must obtain the status as a [visiting PhD candidate](https://www.mn.uio.no/english/research/phd/educational-component/visiting-phd.html) at the UiO Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences. Applications may be submitted starting 15 June 2022 and must be submitted by 1 August 2022.


## Location

The course will be held at the UiO campus, in seminar room 2269 *Python*, on floor 2 in the north end of
[Ole-Johan Dahl's building](https://www.uio.no/english/about/getting-around/areas/gaustad/ga06/), Gaustadalléen 23B, Oslo.

## Meals

Coffee and tea will be freely available each morning in the seminar room.

For lunch, we recommend the canteen in the other end of the building, [Ole-Johan spiseri](https://www.sio.no/en/food-and-beverage/our-canteens-and-coffeeshops/informatikk-kafeen), which serves a nice selection of warm and cold dishes.

We plan to organize a free dinner for all course participants in a restaurant in Oslo on October 20th.

We also plan to order pizza on October 27th. Details will follow.


## Requirements

* We recommend that participants should have a basic understanding of molecular biology as provided by an introductory course in bioinformatics, molecular biology, or genetics.

* No formal background in computer science is required, however, students must have a basic understanding of the unix shell. Students should take an introductory unix course beforehand if they do not have these skills.


## Computers/laptops, Wifi, internet access, and Educloud accounts
 
All students must have a laptop with either Windows (version 10 or more recent), macOS, Linux or other Unix operating system. You need to be able to access the Eduroam wifi network. If you do not have a UiO or Eduroam account, a temporary Wifi account may be created for you.

We advise you to bring an external mouse, and do not rely on touchpad/trackpad only.

The course will use computational resources on the Educloud Fox system at UiO. [Access to Educloud](Educloud/index.md) will be provided for all course participants.

If you are struggling with anything of the above, you must contact the course coordinator (see contact details on this page) as soon as possible, and at least one week before the start of the course.


## Curriculum and suggested reading
 
The curriculum consists of a set of scientific articles. The exam will contain questions on the material presented in these papers on the material covered during the course. Specific details of the curriculum, and a list of further suggested papers, can be found [here](Curriculum/index.md).


## Exam

The exam will be a combination of the following two parts:

 * an *individual* home project combined with an oral exam presentation of the home project followed by questioning / discussion on December 1st and 2nd. Students will present their work to 2 teachers, followed by some questioning (approx 20 minutes in total for each student). This home exam will be handed out to all participants after the lectures. Time slots will be assigned randomly.
 * a 2 hour written digital exam at Silurveien 2 on December 1st 2022 from 17.00 to 19.00.

* Others to be announced (TBA).

## Contact information

* Torbjørn Rognes (Course coordinator) - e-mail: torognes@ifi.uio.no

## Restaurant Dinner

We plan to organize a dinner for the course participants in a restaurant in Oslo on October 20th. Details will follow.

## Requirements

* We recommend that participants should have a basic understanding of molecular biology as provided by an introductory course in bioinformatics, molecular biology, or genetics.

* No formal background in computer science is required, however, students must have a basic understanding of the unix shell. Students should take an introductory unix course beforehand if they do not have these skills.


## Computers/laptops, internet access, and UiO user account
All students must have a laptop with either a Windows (version 10 or more recent), Unix/Linux, or macOS. It should have:
* Wireless network connection
* You must have modern internet browser installed (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, ...)
* You must have a valid UiO user account and must be able to log onto a computer on the UiO network
  * If you are unsure if you have a UiO user account and a valid password, you should try to log in using kiosk.uio.no as described [here](http://www.uio.no/english/services/it/network/home-and-away/kiosk/index.html). If you are unable to log in, try the hints you find [here](http://www.uio.no/english/services/it/network/home-and-away/kiosk/programkiosk/index.html).
  * Instructions (in Norwegian) about how to find your user name and get a new password can be found [here](http://www.uio.no/tjenester/it/brukernavn-passord/ikke-passord.html).
* We advise to bring an external mouse, and do not rely on touchpad/trackpad only.

If you are struggling with anything of the above, in particular if you have forgotten your UiO user name/password or you do not have one, you must contact the course coordinator (see contact details on this page) as soon as possible, and at least one week before the start of the course.

## Curriculum and suggested reading
The curriculum consists of a set of scientific articles. The exam will
contain questions on the material presented in these papers on the material covered during the course. Specific details of the curriculum, and a list of further suggested papers, can be found [here](Curriculum).

## Exam

The exam for this course will be an *individual* home exam combined with an oral presentation of the home exam and questioning on December 1st and 2nd. Exact time and location to be announced. Students will present their work to 2-3 teachers, followed by some questioning (20-30 minutes in total). This home exam will be handed out to all participants in the week after the lectures.
